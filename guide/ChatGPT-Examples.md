## 撰写文本

### 示例1：写作创意
- **提示词**：Write a short story about a space exploration mission to Mars, focusing on the challenges faced by the astronauts.
- **生成文本**：
  ```text
  The year was 2042, and humanity had finally set its sights on Mars. The crew of the Odyssey was composed of the best and brightest astronauts from around the world. Their mission: to establish the first human colony on the Red Planet. As they approached Mars, they encountered a massive dust storm that threatened to derail their mission. Despite the challenges, the crew worked together, overcoming technical failures and personal fears, to land safely on the Martian surface. Their journey was just beginning, but they were determined to succeed, knowing that the future of humanity depended on their courage and ingenuity.
  ```

### 示例2：技术文档
- **提示词**：Explain the concept of machine learning in simple terms.
- **生成文本**：
  ```text
  Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It's like teaching a child to recognize animals by showing them many pictures of different animals. Over time, the child learns to identify patterns and can recognize new animals on their own. In the same way, machine learning algorithms analyze large datasets to find patterns and make predictions or decisions based on new data. This technology is used in various applications, such as speech recognition, image classification, and recommendation systems.

## 回答问题

### 示例1：简单问答
- **提示词**：What are the benefits of regular exercise?
- **生成文本**：
  ```text
  Regular exercise offers numerous benefits for overall health and well-being. It helps improve cardiovascular health, strengthens muscles and bones, aids in weight management, boosts mental health by reducing stress and anxiety, and enhances sleep quality. Additionally, regular physical activity can increase energy levels and improve mood.
  ```

### 示例2：复杂问答
- **提示词**：How does blockchain technology work and what are its main applications?
- **生成文本**：
  ```text
  Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures security and transparency. Each block in the blockchain contains a list of transactions, and once a block is completed, it is added to the chain in a linear, chronological order. The decentralized nature of blockchain makes it resistant to tampering and fraud. Its main applications include cryptocurrency transactions (e.g., Bitcoin), supply chain management, secure voting systems, and digital identity verification.

## 生成代码

### 示例1：Python代码
- **提示词**：Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number.
- **生成代码**：
  ```python
  def factorial(n):
      if n == 0:
          return 1
      else:
          return n * factorial(n-1)

  # 示例
  print(factorial(5))  # 输出：120
  ```

### 示例2：JavaScript代码
- **提示词**：Create a JavaScript function to find the maximum element in an array.
- **生成代码**：
  ```javascript
  function findMax(arr) {
      let max = arr[0];
      for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
          if (arr[i] > max) {
              max = arr[i];
          }
      }
      return max;
  }

  // 示例
  console.log(findMax([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));  // 输出：5
  ```
